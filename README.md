# Hotkey

HotKey was developed at TreeHacks 2016 as an implementation/case study of a web application that would provide a secure platform for users to share passwords. The idea is mutually beneficial for media providers and users through limiting the scope through which a password could be shared, disabling an unlimited use of another's account, and enhancing security for users' shared passwords.  The application was implemented in Python and MongoDB, with front-end components being done in Angular.js and OSX.
